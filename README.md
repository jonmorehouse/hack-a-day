# Hack-a-Day

Each day, I find a small algorithm, data-structure, systems or mathematics topic to explore and code out.

## Topics

Each topic has its own directory and each **hack** corresponds to its own program within that directory. Each directory's **README** has a list of problems and if they have been completed, a link to a pull-request solving that problem.

* [datastructures](./data_structures)
* [algorithms](./algorithms)
* [challenges](./challenges)
* [mathematics](./mathematics)
* [systems](./systems) 
<-- * [machine-learning](./machine_learning) -->

## Inspiration

I'm doing this because I love computers! There are so many things that I want to learn and code out that the only way I'll get to all of them is by staying organized and making sure I hack on a new small project every day!
